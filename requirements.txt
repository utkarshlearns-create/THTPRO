1. Executive Summary
THTPRO is a tutor-parent matching platform that connects qualified tutors with parents seeking
educational services. The platform operates on a moderated marketplace model where all job postings
and tutor profiles are verified by administrators before going live.
Key Business Model:
 Parents post teaching requirements (jobs)
 Admins verify and approve job postings
 Tutors undergo KYC verification and profile approval
 Approved tutors can explore and apply for approved jobs
 Platform takes a commission on successful hirings
Critical Workflow Requirements:
 Intelligent load distribution among multiple admins
 Two-stage verification: Job approval + Tutor approval
 Automated admin assignment based on workload
 Real-time status tracking for all submissions

2. Platform Overview
User Roles:
Platform Flow:
The platform follows a moderated marketplace approach where quality control is maintained through
admin verification at two critical points: when jobs are posted and when tutors join the platform.

3. Current Implementation Status
Completed Features:
 Google OAuth authentication integration
 Role-based login system (Parent, Tutor, Admin, Superadmin)
 Secret routes for admin and superadmin access
 Separate dashboards for each role
 PostgreSQL database on Render
 React frontend deployed on Vercel
 Django backend infrastructure
Pending Features (To Be Implemented):
 OTP-based phone authentication
 Job posting workflow with admin approval
 Tutor KYC and profile verification workflow
 Automated admin assignment algorithm
 Payment gateway integration (Razorpay/Stripe)
 Commission calculation and distribution system
 Messaging system between parents and tutors
 Review and rating system
 Notification system (Email/SMS/Push)

4. Core Workflow Requirements
4.1 Job Posting Workflow
Flow Diagram:
 1. Parent creates job posting with requirements
 2. System automatically assigns job to an available admin
 3. Admin receives notification of new job assignment
 4. Admin reviews job details and requirements
 5. Admin approves or rejects with feedback
 6. If approved: Job goes live and becomes visible to verified tutors
 7. If rejected: Parent receives feedback and can resubmit
 8. Tutors can browse and apply for approved jobs
Job Posting Requirements:
 Subject/Topic required
 Grade/Class level
 Preferred teaching mode (Online/Offline/Hybrid)
 Location (if offline)
 Session frequency (e.g., 3 times per week)
 Session duration
 Budget range
 Start date
 Additional requirements or notes
4.2 Tutor Onboarding & KYC Workflow
Flow Diagram:
 1. Tutor registers on platform (Google OAuth or OTP)
 2. Tutor completes profile information
 3. Tutor uploads KYC documents (ID proof, certificates, photo)
 4. System automatically assigns KYC request to an available admin
 5. Admin receives notification of new tutor verification request
 6. Admin reviews documents and profile information
 7. Admin verifies authenticity of certificates and credentials
 8. Admin approves or rejects with detailed feedback

 9. If approved: Tutor account is activated and can browse jobs
 10. If rejected: Tutor receives feedback and can resubmit documents
KYC Document Requirements:
 Government-issued ID proof (Aadhaar/PAN/Passport/Driver's License)
 Educational certificates (Highest qualification)
 Teaching certifications (if any)
 Professional photo
 Experience certificates (optional)
 Background verification consent
4.3 Admin Assignment Logic (Critical Requirement)
This is a CORE feature that ensures fair distribution of work among admins and prevents bottlenecks in
the approval process.
Assignment Algorithm Requirements:
The system must implement an intelligent load-balancing algorithm that:
 Tracks the number of pending reviews assigned to each admin in real-time
 Automatically assigns new job postings to the admin with the LEAST pending workload
 Automatically assigns new tutor KYC requests to the admin with the LEAST pending workload
 Maintains separate queues for job approvals and tutor approvals
 Updates admin workload count immediately when items are approved/rejected
 Handles concurrent submissions without duplicate assignments
 Provides a dashboard showing current workload distribution
 Allows superadmin to manually reassign if needed
Example Scenario:
Initial State:
When a new job posting arrives:
 System assigns to Admin B (has least pending jobs: 2)
When a new tutor KYC request arrives:
 System assigns to Admin C (has least pending KYC: 2)

8. Admin Load Balancing Algorithm
This is a critical component that must be implemented correctly to ensure fair distribution of work and
prevent admin burnout.
Algorithm Pseudocode:
For Job Posting Assignment:
 Get all active admins from database Filter admins where is_available = True Sort admins by
pending_job_count ASC Select admin with lowest pending_job_count Assign job to selected admin
Increment admin.pending_job_count by 1 Send notification to admin Update job status to
UNDER_REVIEW
For Tutor KYC Assignment:
 Get all active admins from database Filter admins where is_available = True Sort admins by
pending_kyc_count ASC Select admin with lowest pending_kyc_count Assign KYC to selected
admin Increment admin.pending_kyc_count by 1 Send notification to admin Update tutor status to
UNDER_REVIEW
Important Considerations:
 Use database transactions to prevent race conditions
 Implement row-level locking when assigning to prevent duplicate assignments
 Update pending counts atomically (decrement when approved/rejected)
 Handle edge cases: What if all admins are unavailable?
 Implement a fallback queue if no admins are available
 Log all assignment decisions for audit trail
 Allow superadmin to manually reassign if needed
 Consider implementing a round-robin approach as alternative
 Monitor for admins who consistently have higher pending counts (may indicate performance
issues)

9. Additional Features Required
9.1 OTP Authentication

 OTP valid for 5 minutes
 Maximum 3 attempts allowed
 Rate limiting: Max 3 OTPs per phone per hour
 Store OTP hash in database, not plain text
 After successful verification, create/login user
9.2 Payment Integration
Payment Flow:

 Implement CORS properly for React frontend
 Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse
 Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection
 Implement CSRF protection
 Use secure file upload with virus scanning
 Limit file sizes (max 5MB per document)
 Store uploaded files in S3/Cloudinary, not local filesystem
 Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
 Log all admin actions for audit trail

 Composite index on (subject, grade_level) for job search
Caching Strategy:
 Cache approved job listings (Redis)
 Cache tutor search results
 Invalidate cache when jobs are approved/rejected
Query Optimization:
 Use select_related() for foreign key queries
 Paginate all list views (max 20 items per page)
 Implement lazy loading for images

Background Tasks:

 Use Celery for SMS notifications
 Process payment webhooks asynchronously
 Generate analytics reports in background
10.3 Scalability Considerations
 Use PostgreSQL connection pooling
 Implement CDN for static assets (images, CSS, JS)
 Consider Redis for session management
 Horizontal scaling: Prepare for multiple Django instances
 Use message queues (RabbitMQ/Redis) for inter-service communication
 Monitor database query performance regularly
 Set up proper logging and monitoring (Sentry, New Relic)
 Implement database replication for read-heavy operations

Final Notes for Antigravity Team
This document provides a comprehensive specification of the THTPRO platform workflows and
requirements. The two most critical features that differentiate this platform are:
1. Intelligent Admin Assignment Algorithm: Ensures fair workload distribution and prevents bottlenecks
2. Two-Stage Verification: Both job postings AND tutor profiles must be admin-approved before going
live
These features ensure quality control, build trust with parents, and maintain high standards for tutors on
the platform. The automated admin assignment prevents manual errors and ensures scalability as the
platform grows.
